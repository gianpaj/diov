## 🎮 Game Overview

**Battle Circles** is a fast-paced multiplayer battle royale game where players control circles that grow by eating smaller opponents and collectibles. The last circle standing wins!

### Core Features

- **Multiplayer Action**: 5-12 players per match
- **Fast-Paced Rounds**: 5-minute time limit
- **Size-Based Combat**: Eat smaller players to grow
- **Dynamic Map**: Shrinking boundaries force confrontation
- **Special Abilities**: Split and spit mechanics
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for landscape mobile gameplay

### Game Mechanics

- Move with virtual joystick (left side of screen)
- Eat players smaller than you to grow
- Collect knibbles (food) that spawn randomly
- Use split button to divide into multiple pieces
- Use spit button to lose size and gain speed
- Avoid the shrinking map boundaries
- Survive until you're the last one standing!

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Game Engine**: PIXI.js with @pixi/react
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Networking**: Socket.io
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with styled-jsx

## 🎯 Game Controls

### Mobile Controls (Landscape Mode Required)

- **Virtual Joystick** (Left): Move your circle
- **Split Button** (Right, Top): Split into multiple pieces
- **Spit Button** (Right, Bottom): Spit to lose size and gain speed
- **Pause Button** (Top, Left): Pause the game

### Desktop Controls (for testing)

- **Mouse**: Control virtual joystick
- **Keyboard**: Same button functionality

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component-Based**: Modular React components
- **State Management**: Centralized state with Zustand
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket communication
- **Game Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated PIXI.js
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design with touch controls

### Game Systems

- **Entity System**: Players, Knibbles, SpitBlobs
- **Physics System**: Movement, collision detection
- **Networking**: Client prediction with server reconciliation
- **Camera System**: Smooth following with viewport management
- **Input System**: Touch and mouse input handling

## 🌐 Networking

The game uses WebSocket connections for real-time multiplayer functionality:

- **Connection Management**: Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Game State Sync**: Server-authoritative with client prediction
- **Latency Compensation**: Input prediction and reconciliation
- **Anti-Cheat**: Server-side validation of all game actions

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

- **Landscape Mode**: Enforced landscape orientation
- **Touch Controls**: Optimized virtual joystick and buttons
- **Performance**: 60 FPS target on mobile devices
- **Network**: Optimized for mobile networks
- **PWA Support**: Installable as Progressive Web App

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Player Colors

Edit `src/types/game.ts`:

```typescript
export const COLORS = {
  PLAYER_COLORS: [
    '#FF6B6B', // Add your colors here
    // ... existing colors
  ],
}
```

### Adjusting Game Balance

Edit `src/stores/GameStore.tsx`:

```typescript
const defaultGameConfig: GameConfig = {
  maxPlayers: 12,        // Maximum players per game
  minPlayers: 5,         // Minimum players to start
  gameDuration: 300000,  // Game length in milliseconds
  // ... other config options
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Game won't load**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure you're using a modern browser
   - Clear browser cache and reload

2. **Connection issues**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server is running (if using local server)
   - Check browser's developer tools for WebSocket errors

3. **Performance issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Ensure device has sufficient memory
   - Try reducing browser zoom level

4. **Touch controls not working**
   - Ensure device is in landscape mode
   - Check if touch events are being blocked
   - Try refreshing the page

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 90+ (Recommended)
- **Firefox**: 88+
- **Safari**: 14+
- **Edge**: 90+

## Other Concept Ideas


1. **Blob Royale**

Theme: Colorful goo creatures in a fast-paced shrinking arena
Key Mechanics Differences:
-	Sticky Trails: As players move, they leave behind a sticky trail for 3 seconds. Others slow down if they cross it, allowing ambushes.
-	Combo Bites: Eating two players within 10 seconds triggers a "combo" that gives a short speed boost.
-	Power Blob Events: Every 30 seconds, a super-knibble spawns and grants temporary invincibility (can't be eaten but can eat anyone smaller).

Casual Appeal: Chaotic fun with visual feedback and low skill floor; more forgiving and flashy.

2. **Nibble Rush**

Theme: Candy-like world where you munch to grow
Key Mechanics Differences:
- Boost Zones: Certain areas on the map give players a temporary speed boost if passed over.
- Shrink Bombs: A third button allows you to drop a "shrink bomb" that slightly shrinks everyone in range, including yourself (use strategically).
- Knibble Types: Some knibbles explode, some shrink you slightly, some give double size. Adds casual risk-reward decision making.

Casual Appeal: Whimsical, unpredictable, quick rounds with low punishment.

3. **Circle Splitz**

Theme: Geometric minimalism with arcade flair
Key Mechanics Differences:
- Chain Split Mechanic: You can split more than once in succession, creating up to 20 micro-circles. Perfect control yields big rewards, while poor control leads to chaos.
- Merge Timer: After splitting, players can only merge again after 10 seconds (forces strategy).
- Mirror Clone Power-Up: Occasionally clones your circle for 10 seconds—confuses opponents as both can eat, but only one is real.

Casual Appeal: Tactile, strategic, but visually minimal for players who enjoy clever plays and deception.
